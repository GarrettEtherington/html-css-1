            <p class="basics"> well for starters there's like maybe ten whole caves, however they are all most definetly teeming with things like, wolves, killer monkeys, stone imps, bandits, and i could most definetly keep going. Another amazing attraction is of course the several churches around the place, or well, at least what used to be churches anyway... well, inside of said churches are many valuable things, such as, suspicious goblets that magically make any and all bottles on your person hold more liquid, there are also seeds, and uh, i guess Kale too. Another wonderful attribute this majestic land holds is the fact that lightning will sometimes occasionally potentially just maybe strike somewhere random and go off like a fifty megaton bomb filled with raw power stolen straight from God.  </p>
